name: 'GraphComm: A Graph-based Deep Learning Method to Predict Cell-Cell Communication
  in single-cell RNAseq data'
description: Cell-cell interactions coordinate various functions across cell-types
  in health and disease. Novel single-cell techniques allow us to investigate cellular
  crosstalk at single-cell resolution. Cell-cell interactions are mediated by underlying
  gene-gene networks, however most current methods are unable to account for complex
  inter-connections within the cell as well as incorporate the effect of pathway and
  protein complexes on interactions. Therefore, to utilise relations of cells to ligands
  and receptors as well as multiple annotations, we present GraphComm - a new graph-based
  deep learning method for predicting cell-cell communication in single-cell RNAseq
  datasets. By learning off of a prior model and fine-tuning a network on single-cell
  transcriptomic data, GraphComm is able to predict cell-cell communication (CCC)
  activity across cells, and its impact on downstream pathways, spatially adjacent
  cells and changes due to drug perturbations.
